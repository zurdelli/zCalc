# zCalc

zCalc is a basic Calculator for Android.

The interest in making a functional application for Android, added to the ignorance of the memories of a standard calculator led me to make this calculator.

## Installation
Download the [apk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XpsR4KER15WrLq4n95TCDm70HoJJ4O0w/view?usp=sharing)

## Features
* 4 memory slots

## to-do
I'm interested to work with some API to download some currencies when currency button is pressed.

## Known Issues
* Square root
* Parenthesis
